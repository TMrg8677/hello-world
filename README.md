Learning to use GitHub as a resource for future projects.

I am learning to code as part of my goal of becoming a full stack web developer and software engineer.
I am interested in game development and am currently learning html/css/js for web development and C/C++ for general purpose programming. I have a strong grasp on procedural programming techniques like iteration and conditional logic, and I am beginning to tackle Object Oriented Programming, Indirection, Recursion and Multi-Threading. I am learning about JSON and relational database management systems (SQL). One of my biggest learning goals at the moment is to develop a more mature understanding of how different files and pieces of code in different languages are compiled together into different kinds of software. I want to develop IDE literacy using VSCode and Xcode and am excited to learn to use all of the development resouces that GitHub has to offer!
